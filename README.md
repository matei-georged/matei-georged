# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Distributed Systems and I absolutely love tackling tough challenges. ðŸ’ª I have a deep understanding of how computers and the internet work, and I'm always eager to learn more about emerging technologies. ðŸ¤– I'm particularly passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, and I love exploring new applications for these technologies. ðŸ“š When I'm not busy with school or work, you can usually find me reading science fiction novels or indulging my passion for photography. ðŸ“· Thanks for stopping by my page!


# Projects

## Footwear Detection Deep Learning Application
- Built a deep learning application for footwear detection in images using PyTorch. Trained the model on a GPU cluster and deployed it on a Kubernetes cluster using AzureML. Deployed the model as an API that was consumed by a web application.
- Python, PyTorch, Kubernetes, AzureML

## Language Buddy
- Developed a web platform as part of my undergraduate thesis using .NET, providing a friendly learning environment for young people to find a learning partner and practice together. The application includes features such as text-to-speech, a chat system allowing users to send voice messages, and interactive games designed to enhance learning.
- C#, .NET, Entity Framework, MVC

## Wine Classification using Machine Learning

- This project is a wine classification system that was developed using Apache Spark, Python, and TensorFlow. It involves exploratory data analysis, deep learning model creation, and training on a large dataset to accurately classify red, rose, and white wines. The project takes advantage of Apache Spark's distributed processing and data parallelism to enable efficient model training and evaluation. The primary technologies used in this project include:

- Apache Spark, Python, TensorFlow
