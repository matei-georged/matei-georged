# 👋 Hi there!
My name is Daniel. I'm a student in computer science, soon to be a graduate in distributed systems 😄 . I'm a very curious person. I'm trying to figure out my place on this pale blue dot 🌍⭐.

# What I'm about ❓
This is what I do in my free time:
- Writing my own sci-fi book 📖👽
- Becoming an AI master 🤖🤖🤖
- Writing a tool for automatic detection of possible fraud regarding government contracts 😕💸🏛️
- Building the real-life version of psychohistory, aka a mathematical framework to model societal trends at a macro level 🚀🚀🚀
- Watching anime 🐼
  
Also, at the moment, I'm trying to contribute to the **RawTherapee** open source project as I love photography 📷 and I feel like I need to give something back to the community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑.
